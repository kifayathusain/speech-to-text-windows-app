# TTS Milestone Master Plan

## Authority and scope

Start every Codex session with [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md). Follow the
[authoritative coding standards](../CODING_STANDARDS.md) for every milestone.
This plan carries forward the M01–M10 scope and acceptance criteria from the
existing [master implementation instructions](../Codex-Master-Implementation-Instructions.md).
It adds a mandatory compliance gate without changing the implementation order.

The milestone directory and tracker were absent when this plan was introduced.
No historical milestone statuses are inferred here. Existing Edge TTS, Tkinter
UI, CLI, FFmpeg exports, tests, and Windows packaging work remain intact.
Existing source references to a desktop UI “M02” predate this roadmap and do not
prove completion of the provider-abstraction M02 below.

Implement milestones sequentially. Review existing code before each change;
preserve application boundaries and completed work. Do not start provider
implementation or rewrite modules merely to adopt the coding standards.

## Shared compliance gate

Every milestone below includes the completion gate in
[CODING_STANDARDS.md, section 20](../CODING_STANDARDS.md#20-tooling-and-milestone-completion-gate):

- Pass relevant Ruff formatting and lint checks for changed Python files.
- Run repository-wide checks and existing automated tests; report pre-existing
  violations separately, without unrelated bulk formatting or suppressed rules.
- Add and pass tests for changed behavior, including applicable failure,
  cancellation, and cleanup paths.
- Review code manually for descriptive names, explicit control flow, focused
  responsibilities, type hints, docstrings, error handling, and no compressed
  statements or unnecessary abstractions.
- Preserve existing features and UI/service/provider/model/audio boundaries.
- Verify milestone acceptance criteria, including real-model or Windows checks
  where required, and update documentation.
- Record exact commands, results, limitations, and review evidence in the
  [tracker](MILESTONE_TRACKER.md) before DONE.

Required validation that cannot run blocks DONE. Historical statuses must be
preserved; record their compliance review separately rather than asserting that
older work passed a newly introduced gate. Once verified, use NOT_STARTED,
IN_PROGRESS, BLOCKED, or DONE as defined in the master instructions.

[Milestone document](M06_TEXT_PROCESSING.md)

- Implement sentence-aware chunking.
- Add paragraph pauses.
- Add text normalization.
- Improve long-form generation.
- Add output metadata and chunk tracking.

**Acceptance:** Long text generates in the correct order without missing or duplicated text, and output joins are audibly acceptable.
